Classify verbs using actants as features

The code in this project allows you to use the Mate tools from https://code.google.com/p/mate-tools/ on the data of the sDewac corpus of the Wacky Corpora (http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?id=corpora).
Also contained is an aggregator for verb features, that allows you to aggreate subjects, objects, and aspectual features from sentence trees provided by the mate dependency parser. 
In the near future there will be a step-by-step tutorial how to use the special components.
